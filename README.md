# Intermediate JavaScript Algorithm Scripting

## About the Project
In this project, I solve 21 programming challenges by using JavaScript. These challenges are provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) as a part of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification Module, and can be found [here.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#intermediate-algorithm-scripting)

### Project Status: On-going


## Objectives 
Solving programming challenges by putting together:
* JavaScript fundamentals (syntax, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays & objects) 
* Algorithmic thinking skills
* OOP programming 
* Functional programming


## Technologies
* JavaScript & Node.js
* VS Code
* Git version control & GitHub


## Further Improvements
* Revise the programs regularly to simplify them as much as I can
* Making a webpage by using modules and adding HTML & CSS
